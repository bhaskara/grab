Interactive driver script for the Grab word game.

This script allows playing Grab from the command line with multiple players.
Commands:
- "PLAYER_NUM WORD" - Player attempts to make a word (e.g., "1 cat")
- "PLAYER_NUM" - Player passes
- "draw" - Draw next letter from bag to pool
- "end" - End the game and show final scores
- "help" - Show this help message
- "quit" - Exit without ending game

Usage: python grab_driver.py NUM_PLAYERS
